# SAPscripts
My utility scripts for SAP administration

* **sapup-log-processor.pl** - This script searches for phases end on a sapup.log file, which are listed one phase per line on a input file, and creates an out.csv file with the phase name and the timestamp of ending of that phase. I am using this data with an excel file to estimate times on SAP upgrades.
